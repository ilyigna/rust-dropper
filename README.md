## Rust File Dropper
This is a file dropper made in Rust for personal usage only.

## Features
- Almost FUD[*](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dd550a7eae1ef47395bbc02ac609b154346f62e390242b9118595aa6ae6e690c)
- Downloads as a hidden file with a random string
- Hard to detect (based on my testing)

## How to Set Up
- Set your URL in `src/main.rs`
- Run `cargo build --release` to build the file
- The new executable will be in `target/release`
